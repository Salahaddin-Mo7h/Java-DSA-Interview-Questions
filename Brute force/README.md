# Brute force

- This is the basic and simplest approach for solving a problem
- A brute force is a straight forward apporach to a problem. The first approach that comes in our mind.
- It also works under the trail and error method.

## Problem Solved
- Computing a^n
- String matching
- Closest Pair
- KnapSack problem

## Computing  a^n
The task is to calculate the value of a to the power n.

## String Matching
A string and a pattern will be given, the task is to find the starting index of the pattern in the string.

## Closest pair
Given a set of points in a 2d-plane. The task is to find the closest pair points' distance in the set.

## KnapSack Problem
Given a set of products with their weights and profit value. The task is to fill the bag with the products not excedding the capacity of the bag and to get maximum profit value.
