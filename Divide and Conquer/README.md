# Divide and Conquer

In divide and conquer technique, the given problem is divided into many sub problems and solution of all sub problems are evaluated and the evaluated results are combined to display the final result.

```
algorithm divideandconquer(){
  the problem is divided into sub problems;
  
  while( subproblems are not small)
    the subproblems are further divided;
    
  while(solution of all sub problem are not obtained){
      find the solution of the subproblem;  
  }
  return the combined result of the solutions;
}
```
